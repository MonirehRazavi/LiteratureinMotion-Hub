Group 7 — Publishing Power: Mapping African Novels and Their Publishing Geography

**Subject:**
Global circulation of African authors and the role of publishing geography in shaping whose stories become visible around the world.

**Topic:**
Investigating the publication journey of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s major works by mapping where her books were first published and how those locations, particularly Western publishing centers such as London and New York, shape the global reach of her writing.

**Goal:**
To examine how the publishing geography of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s works influences her international visibility, revealing the power structures that govern which African authors gain global readership. This project explores how reliance on Western publishers affects the circulation of African literature, exposing patterns of literary gatekeeping and the ongoing imbalance between African creative production and Western publishing infrastructure.
