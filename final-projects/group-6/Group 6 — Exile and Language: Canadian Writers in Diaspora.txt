Group 6 — Exile and Language/ Canadian Writers in Diaspora
Subject:
Canadian literature in global migration and exile.
Topic:
Canadian and diasporic writers who have lived, published, or died outside Canada — with a focus on how exile and displacement reshape linguistic identity and literary circulation.
Goal:
To explore how Canadian authors experience exile or long-term residence abroad, and to map how their literary networks shift across languages and borders.
Research questions:
• Where do Canadian writers relocate or die abroad?
• How does linguistic identity (English, French, or heritage language) evolve in exile?
• What global cities become hubs for the circulation of exiled Canadian literature?
