Subject:
Postcolonial adaptations of Shakespeare’s plays.
Topic:
Film and literary adaptations of Shakespeare in Japan, China, and South Korea (1945–present), including translations, remakes, and localized retellings.
Goal:
To analyze how Shakespeare’s plays have been localized, re-appropriated, and at times culturally appropriated in East Asia since 1945 by comparing film and literary adaptations and other appropriative/derivative works across Japan, China, and South Korea; to identify patterns across languages, periods, media, and across different plays (e.g., Hamlet, Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, King Lear).
