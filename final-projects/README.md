# üá®üá¶ Final Project ‚Äî *Mapping Canadian and Indigenous Literatures in Motion*

### üóìÔ∏è Overview

In this final project, your group will contribute to a **collective digital-humanities study** titled:

> **Mapping Literature in Motion: A Collaborative Exploration of Canadian and Indigenous Literatures in Translation**

You will:
1. Design and document your **SPARQL query** to extract literary data from **Wikidata**.
2. Download, clean, and prepare your dataset using **OpenRefine**.

Together, these submissions will form a class-wide dataset on **Canadian and Indigenous literary mobility** ‚Äî which may later become part of a **research publication or conference presentation**.
